Hi and welcome to the general App Notes!

#Known Issues
>-------------
- Saving the game then opening team tab causes the game to crash. 
This is due to the fact that the team is not getting saved.
(Need implementation --Fixed)

- After inventory is full, reopening a platform allows player to continue picking up items.
(Need investigation)

- Lootboxes do not drop amulets.
(Need implementation)

- Lootboxes' RNG is not random enough. 
It favors items with a lower ID number compared to bigger ID numbered items.
Also, it favors collectables a bit too much.
(Need rework)

#Changelog
>---------
[25/07/2023]
- Changed the game saves. It now saves the whole inventory instead of just the id numbers of items.
	>Images are ignored. Created when loading the game.

- Got rid of GameData.HasSavedGame(). It is now obsolete. (Too much work to implement, not worth it)

- Team tab is now successfully displaying the team's characters and items including their stats.
	>Clicking on a character will display the character's stats and items.
	>Clicking on an item will display the item's stats.

- Added the other 2 characters to the game and they are automatically in the team.

- Game detects if player is launching for the first time. 
	>Will create a new blank team and also hand out starter items.
