#Known Issues
>-------------
- When upgrading, it can use a bit too much essence materials, leaving you in the negatives. 
	This tab is incredibly buggy.
(Need investigation --)

- Upgrading items to max level causes the game to crash.
(Need investigation --)

- Deducting XP doesn't work properly on the upgrades tab.
(Need investigation --Removed)

- Inventory doesn't display collectable's stats. It's stuck on one 'random' stat.
(Need investigation --Fixed)

- Need a better way of identifying equipment. Trying to equip one will now randomly equip one of the same type.
	>Need a more specific way of identifying equipment. 
(Need implementation --Fixed) -> Introduced UniqueID

- Saving the game then opening team tab causes the game to crash. 
This is due to the fact that the team is not getting saved.
(Need implementation --Fixed)

- After inventory is full, reopening a platform allows player to continue picking up items.
(Need investigation --Checked, No Issues Encountered)

- Lootboxes do not drop amulets.
(Need implementation --Fixed)

- Lootboxes' RNG is not random enough. 
It favors items with a lower ID number compared to bigger ID numbered items.
Also, it favors collectables a bit too much.
(Need rework --Done)

#Changelog
>---------
[26/08/2023]
- Changed the way of items are equipped.
	>Items weren't a direct reference to the item in the inventory.
	>Now, items are a direct reference to the item in the inventory.
	This caused that if an item got modified, it wouldn't modify the equipped item.

- Fixed all the known issues.
	>Lootbox RNG is now more random.
	>Lootboxes now drop amulets.

- Changed the game saves. It now saves the whole inventory instead of just the id numbers of items.
	>Images are ignored. Created when loading the game.

- Got rid of GameData.HasSavedGame(). It is now obsolete. (Too much work to implement, not worth it)

- Team tab is now successfully displaying the team's characters and items including their stats.
	>Clicking on a character will display the character's stats and items.
	>Clicking on an item will display the item's stats.

- Added the other 2 characters to the game and they are automatically in the team.

- Game detects if player is launching for the first time. 
	>Will create a new blank team and also hand out starter items.
