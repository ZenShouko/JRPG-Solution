Hi and welcome to the general App Notes!

#Known Issues
>-------------
- Saving the game then opening team tab causes the game to crash. 
This is due to the fact that the team is not getting saved.
(Need implementation)

- After inventory is full, reopening a platform allows player to continue picking up items.
(Need investigation)

- Lootboxes do not drop amulets.
(Need implementation)

- Lootboxes' RNG is not random enough. 
It favors items with a lower ID number compared to bigger ID numbered items.
Also, it favors collectables a bit too much.
(Need rework)
